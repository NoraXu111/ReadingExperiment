        "passage": "Over two thousand years ago, Arab traders told enticing tales dedicated to spices such as cinnamon. They would go on about the trials and tribulations associated with cinnamon sticks, perhaps attempting to ward off Greek and Roman competitors, and to elevate and mystify cinnamon and its source. Today, it might seems peculiar that something as seemingly inconsequential as a spice requires this form of guarding. The secret could not be kept for long, as European explorers discovered that spices were plentiful, and it would be easier to access this resource by doing away with the Arabs. Not only did this result in a lasting change into the European diet, but it also changed the definition of wealth, as only the rich and powerful were able to access these exotic commodities before spices made their way to the homes of commoners.",

Scholars have often disagreed concerning when written record-keeping became more like 'literature' than anything else. Moreover, given the significance of distance as a cultural isolator in earlier centuries, the historical development of literature did not occur at an even pace. The problems of creating a uniform global history of literature are compounded by the lost of many texts over the millennia, either deliberately, by accident, or by the total disappearance of the originating culture. Much has been written, for example, about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria in the 1st century BC, and the many key texts which are believed to have been lost forever to the flames. The deliberate suppression of texts (and often their authors) by organizations of either a spiritual or a temporal nature further shrouds the subject.",

        "passage": "There is a sharp decline in dissolved oxygen levels in the world's ocean waters. This kind of oxygen depletion is also known as hypoxia. Hypoxia is mainly a result of agricultural run-off and discharge of industrial waste into the waters. Hypoxic areas are often also referred to as dead zones, which exist worldwide today. Consequences of these dead zones have resulted in a plummet in the population of fish. Fish, like humans, require oxygen for survival. Female fish are at particular risk as oxygen is required to produce more eggs. The production of fewer eggs alters the hormonal states in these fish. This effect on fish biology results in the overproduction of testosterone and inevitably reduces the development of the female reproductive organs. This significantly impacts sustainability of fish species, which may result in very significant changes in marine ecosystems.",

Even though public breastfeeding is legal and perhaps at times socially accepted, some mothers remain reluctant to breastfeed in public because of possible objections, negative comments, and harassment by others. Some mothers claim that they are often given the side eye and asked to leave private and public areas only because of bystanders’ feeling of discomfort. The stigma around breastfeeding is something that many activists and celebrities are working on dismantling nowadays. Given that breastfeeding is a natural part of motherhood, reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and allows for invaluable skin to skin contact, breastfeeding, be it in public or in private, should be always encouraged and destigmatized.",

The average reader today would struggle to fully grasp all of the themes presented in Shakespeare's Hamlet, allowing this literary work to maintain its prestige centuries after it was first written. This snobbery is precisely what has prevented Isabel Allende's The House of Spirits from receiving its due critical acclaim. This novel focuses heavily on Allende's own family history as the cousin once removed of a former Chilean president. She traces the post-colonial social and political upheavals of Chile and their effects on her family with a powerful and original voice.

The World Conservation Union's Red List has reported thousands of threatened species and hundreds of documented extinctions. The numbers are increasing at alarming rates. This increase is a result of the Industrial Revolution, which introduced overfishing, overhunting, habitat destruction for the spread of agriculture, and pesticide and herbicide use, resulting in the release of toxic chemicals. Events such as these have led to the introduction of new food sources, stresses, predators, and threats that the affected species have learned to rapidly adapt to. Drinking water has also become more and more scarce, posing further threats to animal and plant biodiversity. Despite the challenges caused by the Industrial Revolution, both animal and plant species have been able to thrive in their changing environment while also prospering with humans.",

This power cut hit the hospitals hard. There was nothing doctors could do in the complete darkness. Unprepared for the sudden loss of power, some hospitals were unable to power up generators, while others could do so only to power their most vital wards. The problems extended far beyond hospitals as elderly people in high-rise flats were carried down the stairs by neighbouring tenants and people were required to set up candles all over their homes and cook food using fire. Pumps that provided people with running water halted, food spoiled, traffic lights failed, and transportation systems halted.

        "passage": "A very special species of wasps is found in Central and North America and New Zealand. Its larvae are distinguished by their ability to manipulate their hosts into serving as bodyguards. Female wasps of that species oviposit into caterpillar hosts by piercing into the caterpillar with its sharp tube-like organ. After the larvae of this species emerge, the caterpillar takes up position near the cocoons of the pupae, arches its back, and ceases to move or feed. No longer inclined to eat, the affected caterpillar eventually dies. It has been demonstrated in research that this behavior is to strike at and repel possible predators of the pupae. Mortality rates for pupae not guarded by parasitized caterpillars were significantly higher. It is of no demonstrated benefit to the caterpillar, indicating that this is an adaptation on the part of the wasp.",

They remained the world’s export banana until they went extinct in 1965 because of the Panama disease. This fungal disease spread to most banana plantations, also destroying Gros Michel plantations. A new banana called the Cavendish, was thought to be immune to the Panama disease. However, Cavendish bananas are only immune to the strain of the fungus that destroyed the Gros Michel and can be easily infected again. Scientists are trying to modify the banana plant to make it impervious to other strains of the Panama disease. The resulting fruit also needs to taste good, ripen in a predictable amount of time, travel long distances undamaged, and be easy to grow in great quantities. Currently, no hybrid meets all of these criteria.",

Before his publication, the prevailing belief was that the classic four elements (air, fire, earth, and water) comprise all matter and were responsible for all worldly phenomena. Boyle appealed to chemists to experiment and asserted that experiments denied the limiting of chemical elements to only the classic four. He also pleaded that chemistry should cease to be subservient to medicine, and rise to the status of a science. Importantly, he advocated a rigorous approach to scientific experiment: he believed all theories must be proved experimentally before being regarded as true. The work contains some of the earliest modern ideas of atoms, molecules, and chemical reactions, and marks the beginning of the history of modern chemistry.",

The significance of military red as a national symbol was endorsed by King William IV when light dragoons and lancers had scarlet jackets substituted for their previous dark blue, hussars adopted red pelisses, and even soldiers serving in the Royal Navy were obliged to adopt red facings instead of white ones.

Stage fright is experienced by professional performers who are trained to act yet still experience unmooring hits of panic once on stage. Curiously, despite its ability to nearly cripple performers, stage fright is not thought of as a phobia but a subset of glossophobia, the fear of public speaking. Studies have equated actors’ stress levels on opening night to that of a car accident victim. In 'Confessions of an Actor', Laurence Oliver describes stage fright as constantly waiting outside the door, and one needs to either fight it or walk away.

However, Alcott was a knowledgeable speaker who advocated for and pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoiding traditional punishment.
